#### 1. Strategy:
* Consider offering alternative loan products:
The report shows that the most common loan purposes are debt consolidation, credit cards, and home improvement. Businesses could consider offering alternative loan products to meet the needs of these borrowers. For example, they could offer personal loans for debt consolidation, business loans for home improvement, or credit lines for businesses that need access to working capital.
* Invest in marketing and outreach:
With demand for loans strong, businesses may want to invest in marketing and outreach to attract new borrowers. They could target their marketing efforts to specific customer segments, such as businesses in certain industries or businesses located in certain geographic areas.
